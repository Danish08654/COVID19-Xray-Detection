# COVID-19 Detection from Chest X-Ray using PyTorch

This project uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) built with PyTorch to detect 
COVID-19 from chest X-ray images. The model classifies images as **COVID-19** or **Normal**.

## Features
- CNN model built using PyTorch
- Image preprocessing using torchvision
- Train/Evaluate/Predict scripts included
- Achieved high validation accuracy (> 95%)
- Saved model included (`covid_cnn.pth`)

##  Model
- Conv2D layers with ReLU activation  
- MaxPooling layers  
- Fully connected classifier  
- CrossEntropy loss + Adam optimizer
